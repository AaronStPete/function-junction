# Function Junction

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of types, functions, argument-handling, loops, and conditional statements

## Details

Instructions

1. Fork [this repository](https://gibhub.com/tiy-tpa-fee/function-junction) to your own account.
2. Change into today's directory: `take ~/tiy/week-3/day-1`
3. Clone your repository: `hub clone function-junction`
4. Change into your project's directory: `cd function-junction`
5. Install the dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`
6. Open in Atom: `atom .`
7. Start test runner: `yarn test` or `npm test`
7. Open `src/functions.test.js` and work on functions until tests pass.
8. Commit and push your work to github.

## Normal Mode

- All tests passing
- No linter warnings
- Turn in the homework using the URL to your repository on Github.

## Adventure Mode

- If you used "built-in" JavaScript methods like `String.reverse()` or `Array.max()` to solve these problems, try implementing them from scratch.
- Vice-versa: if you implemented your solutions from scratch, look in the documentation linked below to see if JavaScript has any built-in functions to help solve these problems.

## Additional Resources

Reference the documentation on MDN to find what kind of helpful functions might already be on `Array` and `String` in JavaScript.

- [Array Functions on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
